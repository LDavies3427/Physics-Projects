# Physics Computations and Modelling

This repository showcases selected projects from my **MPhys in Theoretical Physics**, demonstrating analytical problem-solving, numerical modelling, and programming applied to physical systems.  
The projects highlight skills in **Python**, **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Numba**, with applications spanning **quantum mechanics**, **simulation**, and **machine learning**.

## 🧮 Contents

### 1. [Quantum Ising Chain Simulation](./quantum_ising_model)
Python implementation of the **1D transverse-field Ising model**, including Hamiltonian construction, eigenvalue analysis, and time-evolution simulations.  
Visualises magnetisation dynamics over time and explores the effects of perturbations on the quantum ground state.

*Skills:* Quantum systems, matrix algebra, numerical simulation, scientific plotting.

### 2. [Numba-Accelerated Computation](./numba_acceleration)
Investigation of **just-in-time compilation** using Numba to accelerate computational physics code.  
Benchmarks performance improvements over standard Python implementations and analyses scalability for large numerical systems.

*Skills:* Python optimisation, JIT compilation, scientific computing, benchmarking.

---

### 3. [Machine Learning in Physics (in progress)](./machine_learning_physics)
An exploratory project applying **machine learning** techniques to identify patterns and relationships in simulated physical data.  
Planned models include regression and classification approaches using `scikit-learn`.

*Skills:* Python, data science, machine learning, applied physics.
